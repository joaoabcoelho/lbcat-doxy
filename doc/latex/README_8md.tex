configuration and test of the calorimeter electronics ref tutorial for a brief tutorial but requiring a specific branch which is called cmake Go to the main directory and adapt the setup sh file You should have only to modify the CATPATH \hyperlink{README_8md_aa9be1efea44c73a389d100be792af698}{variable}
